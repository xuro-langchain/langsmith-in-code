    "\n",
    "1. A **dataset test** inputs and expected outputs.\n",
    "2. An **application or target function** that defines what you are evaluating, taking in inputs and returning the application output\n",

    "1. **Final Response**: Evaluate the agent's final response.\n",
    "2. **Single step**: Evaluate any agent step in isolation (e.g., whether it selects the appropriate tool).\n",
    "3. **Trajectory**: Evaluate whether the agent took the expected path (e.g., of tool calls) to arrive at the final answer."
